/*
 * Path With Minimum Effort
 * You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size
 * rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of the cell (row, col). You 
 * are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, 
 * (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e.,0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish 
 * to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

 * A routeâ€™s effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
